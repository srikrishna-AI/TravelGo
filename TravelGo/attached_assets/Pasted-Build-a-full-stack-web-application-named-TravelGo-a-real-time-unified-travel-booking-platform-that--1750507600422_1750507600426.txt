Build a full-stack web application named TravelGo, a real-time unified travel booking platform that enables users to search, compare, and book various travel services such as buses and hotels. This application should offer:

A Python-based backend (FastAPI or Flask)

MySQL as the relational database layer

A responsive frontend of your choice (React, Angular, or simple HTML/CSS/JS)

Cloud-ready architecture (AWS-compatible), but deployment on local/dev environment

ðŸ›  System Requirements & Functionalities
âœ… Core Functionalities (MVP):
User Authentication:

User registration & secure login

Session/token-based authentication

Role-based access if needed (user vs admin)

Service Search & Display:

View available travel services (initially: buses and hotels)

Filter by location, price, availability

Display detailed information about services

Booking Management:

Book a selected travel service

View upcoming & past bookings

Cancel an existing booking

Real-Time Availability:

Ensure bookings reflect current availability

Handle concurrency using transaction locks (e.g., during double booking attempts)

User Profile & History:

View personal details

View history of all bookings and status

Validation & Error Handling:

Form validations on both frontend and backend

Proper error handling (e.g., service not available, login failure)

ðŸ§° Tech Stack Constraints
Backend: Python (FastAPI preferred for async support, or Flask)

Database: MySQL (structured data for bookings, users, services)

Frontend: Any modern JS framework (React recommended), or simple HTML+Bootstrap

Deployment: Must be cloud-compatible (e.g., works with EC2 & RDS), but keep local deployment only

ðŸ’¡ Extended Features (Optional / Future Scope)
Support for additional travel services (flights, trains)

Advanced search filters (ratings, distance, amenities)

Integrated payment gateway

Dynamic pricing engine (based on demand or season)

Admin panel for managing services and bookings

Itinerary planner for full trip management

Mobile-friendly responsive UI or mobile app

ðŸ“Š Business & Social Impact
Reduces friction in travel planning by consolidating services

Improves conversion rates for travel vendors by offering one-stop booking

Enables trend tracking, business analytics, and promotional targeting

Helps travelers minimize time, errors, and stress in planning

ðŸš§ Key Design Challenges
Real-time consistency of availability (avoid overbooking)

Handling concurrent bookings and payment transactions

Scalable architecture for future cloud migration

Clean and intuitive UI/UX to appeal to non-technical users

ðŸ“Œ Deliverables
Source code (frontend + backend)

MySQL schema with sample seed data

API documentation (can be Swagger UI if FastAPI)

README with:

Local setup instructions

Database migration/setup

API routes and test data

(Optional) Screenshots / demo video
